# Hello reader!  
### My name is Sebastian Colie, and I am so delighted to have you join my community! I love to run, write, play chess, play piano, and teach, and I am ecstatic to be able to share my ideas and thoughts with you. I look forward to sharing my experiences with you, and to engage in wonderful thought and creativity. I believe that together we can inspire and influence each other to speak and act upon our ideas and our minds. Thank you for taking the time to read and appreciate my thoughts and opinions, and I hope you also offer some of your own creativity in the future. I hope you enjoy your time here with me as we embark upon this journey of thought, innovation, and learning.
