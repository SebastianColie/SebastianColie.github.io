**Passion** 

---


Passion is one of the most vital components to anything--yes, _anything_-- in life. Without passion, all you really have is pointless and wasted talent. To have a passion for something pretty much means to have a determined and driven desire to achieve a goal or acquire a talent. Passion brings flavor to achievement and is the one thing that pushes you beyond others. My passion is, unsurprisingly, writing, something in which I partake in all the time. I enjoy writing! Your passion doesn't have to be something mainstream though; it's anything you really like to do. If you like coding, great! If you like cooking, awesome! I could give examples forever. Not the point. Just remember: **always do what you love, and _always_ love what you do.**
