**Passion** 

---


Passion is one of the most vital components to anything--yes, _anything_-- in life. Without passion, all you really have is pointless and wasted talent. To have a passion for something pretty much means to have a determined and driven desire to achieve a goal or acquire a talent. Passion brings flavor to achievement and is the one thing that pushes you beyond others. My passion is, unsurprisingly, writing, something in which I partake in all the time. I enjoy writing! Your passion doesn't have to be something mainstream though; it's anything you really like to do. If you like coding, great! If you like cooking, awesome! If you like sitting on tops of mountains and eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches while tapping your feet, that's great! However, it might be a little tough to find a line of work being a sandwich eating mountain climber. Not that point. Just remember to always do what you love, and _always_ love what you do. (You can quote me on that)
